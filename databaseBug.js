This error occurs when you try to access a Firebase Realtime Database reference before it's fully initialized.  This commonly happens when you try to read or write data in the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method of a React component, or an equivalent method in another framework, before the Firebase app has finished initializing. The database may appear initialized, but its internal state isn't fully ready.
