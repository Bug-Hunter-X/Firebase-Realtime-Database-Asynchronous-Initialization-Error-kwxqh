# Firebase Realtime Database Asynchronous Initialization Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Firebase Realtime Database: attempting to access the database before it's fully initialized. This often leads to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The provided code showcases the error and its solution.

## Problem

The core issue is that Firebase initialization is asynchronous.  If you try to interact with the database before the `initializeApp` promise resolves, you'll encounter this error.  This is often seen when data fetching is attempted immediately within componentDidMount, before the Firebase app has had time to fully initialize.

## Solution

The solution involves waiting for the Firebase app to initialize successfully before accessing the database.  This can be done using async/await or promises.
